# NPS Hosts Manager
NPS Hosts Manager is a small gui program to quickly manage the Windows hosts file
located @ \Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

Program features:

1. Backup
	- backup hosts file to any folder
	- name it anything (but defaults to hosts_\<date\>.bak)
	- great way to save multiple versions
1. Replace
	- replace hosts file with any file you want (but should be a hosts file of course lol)
	- great for restoring those backups
1. Restore
	- restore the hosts file to Windows defaults
1. Edit
	- opens hosts in basic Notepad
	- opens in Read/Write mode even if the file is Read Only
	- resets the file to Read Only if it was set to Read Only before it was launched after save
	- there was no need to build an editor since there is no need for syntax highlighting
1. Read/Write
	- set Read/Write state of the hosts file on the fly
